                <p> 
                    I discovered programming when I was 14 years old and was inspired by the endless possibilities of what could be done with it.
                    So, I decided to learn how to code on my own using the website Khan Academy.
                    I created some small games using their programming interface and I was hooked.
                    I enjoyed the challenges I faced when writing code, and felt accomplished when I finally got it to work.
                    By the time I started my first programming course in grade 10, I was already a good programmer.
                    As I honed my Java programming skills throughout my high school career, I was also constantly helping others in my computer science class who were struggling with their code.
                    I enrolled in the University of Toronto (St. George campus) in 2019, and by the end of the school year, I had become proficient in Python and selected my major as a computer science specialist.
